detect newline problems, e.g. a stray ^M at end of file seems to cause read error, but
the char does not show up in most editors including jnyqide.


=================
Documentation for Adagio should go somewhere. It's mentioned in the nyquist 
manual, but there's no reference or URL for CMT.

Thanks for the prompt response.
it may help if I give you the preference file (OS9) that I created for 
v 2.29 that caused(?) the error message:

PREF File in OS9 prefs folder:
> XLISPPATH=Macintosh HD:Users:robwilkinson:SUBJECT
> index:PROJECTS:Nyquist/Audacity Plugins:nyquist.229:runtime

Resulting error message: XLISP version 2.0, Copyright (c) 1986, by 
David Betz
> CMU MIDI Toolkit, Copyright (c) 1993,1994, by Roger B. Dannenberg 
> Macintosh interface by Brian Kendig, Erik A. Dahl, and Dominic 
> Mazzoni.
> error: file name too long - NIL

Regards
Rob



No matter what I do to the file name by altering the preferences file I get the same message.
I thought it might have something to do with the extended(>32) filename length in OSX but even very short 
names do not work.
Otherwise 2.29 works fine.

2) Version 2.30 unpacked ok but there was no file named Nyquist and no icon. Could not persuade it to run. 
Altho very late at night I tried to invoke "ny" using Terminal and remember getting the above error message. 
Could not repeat the experience tho'.

I downloaded Nyquist to experiment with making a Declipper Effect for Audacity.
In the learning process I found that none of the Nyquist effects actually work in Audacity. 
In particular the lp and hp effects. Wrote a simple clipper effect & it did not work either. 
Is this of interest to you?

Finally have you any suggestions which Nyquist functions I should focus on to find flat topped 
peaks in a sound file.
ie to find 3 or more adjacent identical samples not just test for equality to +/- maximum value. 
The maths for splining in sine or parabolic cap are straight forward if I can extract the flat 
section and the 3 samples that precede and follow it.

I'm a semi-retired EE not experienced in Lisp or C

missing end-of-line causes crash? - not on windows, try others

fix, test seqmidi to take note, ctrl, prgm, etc.
-----

multiseq.c assumes all signals have same sample rate.  I think this could
be fixed merely by saving an array of sample rates so that zero signals
of the proper rate could be generated later.  Also be sure to free the
array of sample rates when the multiseq struct is freed.

Each chapter requires:

* Programming Instructions (this is done)
* Programming Tips (this need more work)
* Programming Misconceptions (this you do at times)
* Conceptual overview
    1. details for particular cases
    2. generalization of the particular cases
    3. summary notes for each chapter
The idea of a user manual in addition to a documentation manual
for nyquist is in order.

Something with more step by step instructions. You may not have a graphic 
interface but the manual could have a more graphic approach to nyquist.

The issue of analysis/resynthesis within nyquist is not spelled out. Since 
the technique of analysis/resynthesis was such a force in the creation of 
Nyquist you could think of gearing your presentation of Nyquist in those 
terms within a User's Manual for Nyquist.  The point of which is to give a better presentation of 
Nyquist as a tool for analysis/resynthesis rather than a theory on 
analysis/resynthesis.

An example of the problem with the manual is evident in the \
like of treatment of say recorded samples (soundfiles and sound synthesis):

1. mono
2. stereo
3. mixing

There is the additional question of using a soundfile to go between one of 
these 3 cases.  All of this would fill a section on Multichannels.  
There are sets of terminology which could be listed at the start of each 
chapter which could be organized in some kind of concept graph.  \

Warping
Behavior
Abstract Behavior:
    * Parameterization of Behaviors
    * Flexibility of Parameterization \
Transformation
Transformation Environment

These ideas are very dense and need more development within a user's manual.
In part the matter of warping in nyquist and time-warping Practices could 
also be discussed (discrete and continuous).
