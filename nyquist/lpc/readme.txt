; LPC functions for Nyquist
; Pedro J. Morales, 2004

1. Compile Nyquist with LPC functions
   See file compile.txt for details
   Source code is in src folder

2. Reference of LPC primitives.
   See file prims-ref.txt

3. Implementation of high level LPC Lisp functions
   File: lpc.lsp

4. Reference of high level LPC Lisp functions
   See file lpc.lsp

5. LPC demo
   5.1. Compile and start Nyquist
   5.2. Load lpc.lsp
   5.3. Edit lpcdemo.lsp and configure it.
   5.4. Load lpcdemo.lsp
        Note: lpcdemo should perform an analysis of an audio file.
              This audio file is not supplied (for size reasons)
              Instead, the result is supplied as a Lisp data structure
              contained in the file lpc-example.dat that is loaded by lpcdemo.
   5.5. Run the examples.
        Note: You don't have to run all the examples
