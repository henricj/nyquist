test-client sends OSC messages to Nyquist.

The default behavior is to generate a low frequency triangle that
simulates ramping slider 0 up and down.

On the Mac, you build this with the osc-test-client target in Xcode.
You can find the executable in:
     nyquist/macosxproject/build/Development/osc-test-client
and you can run this from a terminal window (or with Xcode)
