* Full bundle support [needs NTP, argh], find budle timestamp delivery
  artimetic bug

* More/better regression tests

* More/better example code

* Normalise URI handling [needs discussion]

* GTK/Qt/etc. linking code [belongs in another library]

* Rendevous/OpenWhatever (eg. howl) service discovery [low priority]

* Think about a JACK transport layer [maybe^W probably not, low priority]

  from every conneciton, then closes, dont think this is right) [low priority]
