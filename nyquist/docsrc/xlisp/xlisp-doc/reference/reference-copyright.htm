<p>This document is intended to serve as a reference for the XLISP 2.0 dialect
of LISP. It includes a description of each symbol, function, special form and
keyword available in XLISP. This reference is not a complete and extensive
introduction to LISP programming.</p>

<p>If you find problems with the reference or find that I have left something
out, drop me a line. If you find this useful, I would be interested in hearing
that as well. If you are into 'pretty' looking documents (as opposed to plain
ASCII text), I have a TeX version of the reference.</p>
