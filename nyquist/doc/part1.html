This manual is a guide for users of Nyquist, a language for composition and
sound synthesis.  Nyquist grew out of a series of research projects, notably
the languages Arctic and Canon.  Along with Nyquist, these languages promote a
functional style of programming and incorporate time into the language
semantics.

Nyquist is a successor to Fugue, a language originally implemented by Chris
Fraley, and extended by George Polly and Roger Dannenberg.  Peter Velikonja
and Dean Rubine were early users, and they proved the value as well as
discovered some early problems of the system.  This led to Nyquist, a
reimplementation of Fugue by Roger Dannenberg with help from Joe Newcomer
and Cliff Mercer.

I also wish to acknowledge support from CMU, Yamaha, and IBM for this work.
