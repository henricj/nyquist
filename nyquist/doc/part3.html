<a name = "16"><h2>Behavioral Abstraction</h2></a><a name="index59">

In Nyquist, all functions are subject to
transformations<a name="index60">.  You can think of transformations as
additional parameters to every function, and functions are free to use these
additional parameters in any way.  The set of transformation parameters is
captured in what is referred to as the <i>transformation
environment<a name="index61"></i>.  (Note that the term
<i>environment</i> is heavily overloaded in computer science.  This is yet
another usage of the term.)
<p>
Behavioral abstraction is the ability of functions to adapt their behavior
to the transformation environment.  This environment may contain certain
abstract notions, such as loudness, stretching a sound in time, etc.  These
notions will mean different things to different functions.  For example, an
oscillator should produce more periods of oscillation in order to stretch
its output.  An envelope, on the other hand, might only change the
duration of the sustain portion of the envelope in order to stretch.
Stretching a sample could mean resampling it to change its duration by the
appropriate amount.
<p>
Thus, transformations in Nyquist are not simply operations on signals.  For
example, if I want to stretch a note, it does not make sense to compute the
note first and then stretch the signal.  Doing so would cause a drop in the
pitch.  Instead, a transformation modifies the <i>transformation
environment</i> in which the note is computed.  Think of transformations as
making requests to functions.  It is up to the function to carry out the
request.  Since the function is always in complete control, it is possible
to perform transformations with ``intelligence;'' that is, the function can
perform an appropriate transformation, such as maintaining the desired pitch
and stretching only phase 3 of an envelope to obtain a longer note.
<p>
<a name = "17"><h3>The Environment</h3></a><a name="index62">

The transformation environment consists of a set of special Lisp variables.
These variables should not be read directly and should <i>never</i> be set
directly by the programmer.  Instead, there are functions to read them, and
they are automatically set and restored by
transformation operators, which will be described below.
<p>
The transformation environment consists of the following elements.  Although
each element has a ``standard interpretation,'' the designer of an
instrument or the composer of a complex behavior is free to interpret the
environment in any way.  For example, a change in <code>*loud*</code> may change
timbre more than amplitude, and <code>*transpose*</code> may be ignored by
percussion instruments:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>
 <code>*warp*<a name="index63"></code><dd>Time transformation, including time shift,
time stretch, and continuous time warp.  The value of <code>*warp*</code> is
interpreted as a function from logical (local score) time to physical
(global real) time.  Do not access <code>*warp*</code> directly.  Instead, use
<code>(local-to-global <i>t</i>)</code> to
 convert from a logical (local) time to physical (global) time.  Most often,
you will call <code>(local-to-global 0)</code>.  Several transformation operators
operate on <code>*warp*</code>, including <code>at</code>, <code>stretch</code>, and
<code>warp</code>.<br><br>
<dt> <code>*loud*<a name="index64"></code><dd>Loudness, expressed in decibels.  The default
(nominal) loudness is 0.0 dB (no change).  Do not access <code>*loud*</code>
directly.  Instead, use <code>(get-loud)</code> to get the current value of
<code>*loud*</code> and either <code>loud</code> or <code>loud-abs</code> to modify it.<br><br>
<dt> <code>*transpose*<a name="index65"></code><dd>Pitch transposition, expressed in
semitones.  (Default: 0.0).  Do not access <code>*transpose*</code> directly.
Instead, use <code>(get-transpose)</code> to get the current value of
<code>*transpose*</code> and either <code>transpose</code> or <code>transpose-abs</code> to
modify it.<br><br>
<dt> <code>*sustain*<a name="index66"></code><dd>The ``sustain,'' ``articulation,'' ``duty
factor,'' or amount by which to separate or overlap sequential notes.  For
example, staccato might be expressed with a <code>*sustain*</code> of 0.5, while very
legato playing might be expressed with a <code>*sustain*</code> of 1.2.
Specifically, <code>*sustain*</code> stretches the duration of notes (sustain)
without affecting the inter-onset time (the rhythm).  Do not access
<code>*sustain*</code> directly.  Instead, use <code>(get-sustain)</code> to get the
current value of <code>*sustain*</code> and either <code>sustain</code> or
<code>sustain-abs</code> to modify it.<br><br>
<dt> <code>*start*<a name="index67"></code><dd>Start time of a clipping region.  <i>Note:</i>
unlike the previous elements of the environment, <code>*start*</code> has a
precise interpretation: no sound should be generated before <code>*start*</code>.
This is implemented in all the low-level sound functions, so it can
generally be ignored.  You can read <code>*start*</code> directly, but use
<code>extract</code> or <code>extract-abs</code> to modify it.  <b><i>Note 2:</i></b> Due to some internal confusion between the specified starting time and the actual starting time of a signal after clipping, <code>*start*</code> is not fully implemented.<br><br>
<dt> <code>*stop*<a name="index68"></code><dd>Stop time of clipping region.  By analogy to
<code>*start*</code>, no sound should be generated after this time.
<code>*start*</code> and
<code>*stop*</code> allow a composer to preview a small section of a work without computing it from beginning to end.  You can read <code>*stop*</code> directly, but use <code>extract</code> or <code>extract-abs</code> to modify it.  <b><i>Note:</i></b> Due to some internal confusion between the specified starting time and the actual starting time of a signal after clipping, <code>*stop*</code> is not fully implemented.<br><br>
<dt><code>*control-srate*<a name="index69"></code><dd>Sample rate of control signals.  This environment
element provides the default sample rate for control signals.  There is no
formal distinction between a control signal and an audio signal.  You can read <code>*control-srate*</code> directly, but use <code>control-srate</code> or <code>control-srate-abs</code> to modify it.<br><br>
<dt> <code>*sound-srate*<a name="index70"></code><dd>Sample rate of musical sounds.  This environment element provides the default sample rate for musical sounds.  You can read <code>*sound-srate*</code> directly, but use <code>sound-srate</code> or <code>sound-srate-abs</code> to modify it.<br><br>
<dt></dl><a name = "18"><h3>Sequential Behavior</h3></a><a name="index71">
Previous examples have shown the use of <code>seq</code>, the sequential behavior
operator.  We can now explain <code>seq</code> in terms of transformations.
Consider the simple expression:
<pre>
(play (seq (note c4 q) (note d4 i)))
</pre>

The idea is to create the first note at time 0, and to start the next
note when the first one finishes.  This is all accomplished by manipulating
the environment.  In particular, <code>*warp*</code> is modified so that what is
locally time 0 for the second note is transformed, or warped, to the logical
stop time of the first note.
<p>
One way to understand this in detail is to imagine how it
might be executed: first, <code>*warp*</code> is set to an initial value that has no
effect on time, and <code>(note c4 q)</code> is evaluated.  A sound is returned and
saved.  The sound has an ending time, which in this case will be <code>1.0</code>
because the duration <code>q</code> is <code>1.0</code>.  This ending time, <code>1.0</code>,
is used to construct a new <code>*warp*</code> that has the effect of shifting
time by 1.0.  The second note is evaluated, and will start
at time 1.  The sound that is
returned is now added to the first sound to form a composite sound, whose
duration will be <code>2.0</code>.  <code>*warp*</code> is restored to its initial value.
<p>
Notice that the semantics of <code>seq</code> can be expressed in terms of
transformations.  To generalize, the operational rule for <code>seq</code> is:
evaluate the first behavior according to the current <code>*warp*</code>.
Evaluate each successive behavior with <code>*warp*</code> modified to shift the
new note's starting time to the ending time of the previous behavior.
Restore <code>*warp*</code> to its original value and return a sound which is the
sum of the results.  
<p>
In the Nyquist implementation, audio samples are only computed when they are
needed, and the second part of the <code>seq</code> is not evaluated until the
ending time (called the logical stop time) of the first part.  It is still
the case that when the second part is evaluated, it will see <code>*warp*</code>
bound to the ending time of the first part.  
<p>
A language detail: Even though Nyquist defers evaluation of the second part of the <code>seq</code>, the expression can reference variables according to ordinary Lisp scope rules.  This is because the <code>seq</code> captures the expression in a closure, which retains all of the variable bindings.
<p>
<a name = "19"><h3>Simultaneous Behavior</h3></a><a name="index72">
Another operator is <code>sim</code>, which invokes multiple behaviors at the same
time.  For example,
<pre>
(play (scale 0.5 (sim (note c4 q) (note d4 i))))
</pre>

will play both notes starting at the same time.
<p>
The operational rule for <code>sim</code> is: evaluate each behavior at the
current <code>*warp*</code> and return the result.  The following example uses
<code>sim</code> and illustrates two concepts: first, a <i>sound</i> is not a
<i>behavior</i>, and second, the <code>at</code> transformation can be used to place
sounds in time.
<p>
<a name = "20"><h3>Sounds vs. Behaviors</h3></a><a name="index73">
The following example loads a sound from a file in the current directory and stores it in <code>a-snd</code>:
<pre>
<i>; load a sound
;</i>
(setf a-snd (s-read "./demo-snd.nh" :srate 22050.0))
<p>
<i>; play it
;</i>
(play a-snd)
</pre>

<p>
One
might think that the following would then work:
<pre>
(seq a-snd a-snd)  <i>;WRONG!</i>
</pre>

but in fact, the result would not be a sequence of two sounds.  Why?  Recall
that <code>seq</code> works by modifying <code>*warp*</code>, not by operating on
sounds.  So, <code>seq</code> will proceed by evaluating <code>a-snd</code> with
different values of <code>*warp*</code>.  However, the result of evaluating
<code>a-snd</code> (a Lisp variable) is always the same sound, regardless of the
environment; in this case, the second <code>a-snd</code> will start at time
<code>0.0</code>, just like the first.
<p>
How then do we obtain a sequence of two sounds?  What we really need here is a
behavior that transforms a given sound according to the current
transformation environment.  That job is performed by <code>cue</code>.  For
example, the following will behave as expected, producing a sequence of two
sounds:
<pre>
(seq (cue a-snd) (cue a-snd))
</pre>

<p>
The lesson here is very important: <b><i>sounds are not behaviors!</i></b>  Behaviors
are computations that generate sounds according to the transformation
environment.  Once a sound has been generated, it can be stored, copied,
added to other sounds, and used in many other operations, but sounds are
<i>not</i> subject to transformations.  To transform a sound, use <code>cue</code>,
<code>sound</code>, or <code>control</code>.  The differences between these operations
are discussed later.  For now, here is a ``cue sheet'' style score that
plays 4 copies of <code>a-snd</code>:
<p>
<pre>
<i>; use sim and at to place sounds in time
;</i>
(play (sim (at 0.0 (cue a-snd))
	   (at 0.7 (cue a-snd))
	   (at 1.0 (cue a-snd))
	   (at 1.2 (cue a-snd))))
</pre>

<p>
<a name = "21"><h3>The At Transformation</h3></a><a name="index74">
The second concept introduced by the previous example is the <code>at</code>
operation, which shifts the <code>*warp*</code> component of the environment.  For
example,
<pre>
(at 0.7 (cue a-snd))
</pre>

can be explained operationally as follows: modify <code>*warp*</code> by shifting
it by <code>0.7</code> and evaluate <code>(cue a-snd)</code>.  Return the resulting sound
after restoring <code>*warp*</code> to its original value.  Notice how <code>at</code>
is used inside a <code>sim</code> construct to locate copies of <code>a-snd</code> in
time.  This is the standard way to represent a note-list or a cue-sheet in
Nyquist.
<p>
This also explains why sounds need to be <code>cue</code>'d in order to be shifted
in time or arranged in sequence.  If this were not the case, then <code>sim</code>
would take all of its parameters (a set of sounds) and line them up to start
at the same time.  But <code>(at 0.7 (cue a-snd))</code> is just a sound, so
<code>sim</code> would ``undo'' the effect of <code>at</code>, making all of the sounds
in the previous example start simultaneously, in spite of the <code>at</code>.
Since <code>sim</code> respects the intrinsic starting times of sounds, a special
operation, <code>cue</code>, is needed to create a new sound with a new starting
time.
<p>
<a name = "22"><h3>Nested Transformations</h3></a><a name="index75">
Transformations can be combined using nested expressions.  For example,
<pre>
(sim (cue a-snd)
     (loud 6.0 (at 3.0 (cue a-snd))))
</pre>

scales the amplitude as well as shifts the second entrance of <code>a-snd</code>.
<p>
Transformations can also be applied to groups of behaviors:
<pre>
(loud 6.0 (sim (at 0.0 (cue a-snd))
	       (at 0.7 (cue a-snd))))
</pre>

<p>
<a name = "23"><h3>Defining Behaviors</h3></a><a name="index76">
Groups of behaviors can be named using <code>defun</code> (we already saw this
in the definitions of <code>note</code> and <code>note-env</code>).  Here is another example
of a behavior definition and its use.  The definition has one parameter:
<pre>
(defun snds (dly)
  (sim (at 0.0 (cue a-snd))
       (at 0.7 (cue a-snd))
       (at 1.0 (cue a-snd))
       (at (+ 1.2 dly) (cue a-snd))))
<p>
(play (snds 0.1))
(play (loud 0.25 (stretch 0.9 (snds 0.3))))
</pre>

In the last line, <code>snds</code> is transformed: the transformations will apply
to the <code>cue</code> behaviors within <code>snds</code>.  The <code>loud</code>
transformation will scale the sounds by <code>0.25</code>, and <code>stretch</code> will
apply to the shift (<code>at</code>) amounts <code>0.0</code>, <code>0.7</code>, <code>1.0</code>,
and <code>(+ 1.2 dly)</code>.  The sounds themselves (copies of <code>a-snd</code>) will
not be stretched because <code>cue</code> never stretches sounds.
<p>
Section <a href = "part6.html#51">``Transformations''</a> describes the full set of transformations.
<p>
<a name = "24"><h3>Sample Rates</h3></a>
<a name="index77">
The global environment contains <code>*sound-srate*</code> and
<code>*control-srate*</code>, which determine the sample rates of sounds and
control signals.  These can be overridden at any point by the
transformations <code>sound-srate-abs</code> and <code>control-srate-abs</code>; for
example,
<pre>
(sound-srate-abs 44100.0 (osc c4))
</pre>

will compute a tone using a 44.1Khz sample rate.
<p>
<a name="index78">
As with other components of the environment, you should <i>never</i> change
<code>*sound-srate*</code> or <code>*control-srate*</code> directly with <code>setf</code> or
even <code>let</code>.  The global environment is determined by two additional
variables: <code>*default-sound-srate*</code> and <code>*default-control-srate*</code>.
You can add lines like the following to your <code>init.lsp</code> file to change
the default global environment:
<pre>
(setf *default-sound-srate* 44100.0)
(setf *default-control-srate* 1102.5)
</pre>

If you have already started Nyquist and want to change the defaults, the
following functions should be used:
<pre>
(set-control-srate 1102.5)<a name="index79">
(set-sound-srate 22050.0)<a name="index80">
</pre>

These modify the default values and reinitialize the Nyquist environment.
