<h1>Sequence Example</h1>

<p>A sequence of notes is often specified by a &quot;note list,&quot; consisting of times,
durations, other transformations, and a parameterized behavior to generate the sound. The
following is an example:</p>

<pre>(defun ringpat1 () 
  (scale 0.8 
    (sim
      (scale 0.6 (at 0.0 (ring 0.6 45 2)))
      (scale 0.5 (at 0.2 (ring 0.8 40 1.5)))
      (scale 0.8 (at 0.6 (ring 1 44 1)))
      (scale 0.7 (at 0.8 (ring 1.2 32 0.8))) 
    )))</pre>

<p>Notice that there are 4 sounds. The sounds are shifted in time using the <code>at</code>
transformation, and all four sounds are combined using the <code>sim</code> construction.
Because of the time shifts, the sounds do not take place simultaneously, but they may
overlap somewhat.</p>

<p>Durations are specified by the first parameter to <code>ring</code>, so no <code>stretch</code>
transformations are used here. Each sound is individually scaled.</p>

<p>To play this sound, you need the <code>ring</code> function from <a
href="scratch_tutorial.htm">Vinal Scratch Tutorial</a>. Then you can type:</p>

<pre>(play (ringpat1))</pre>

<p>Try the following combination, which plays a short and long version of <code>ringpat1</code>
at about the same time:</p>

<pre>(play (sim
        (scale 1.0 (at 0.0 (ringpat1)))
        (scale 0.7 (at 0.05 (stretch 1.5 (ringpat1)))) ))</pre>
