<h1>Warble Tutorial</h1>

<p>The warble function by Alex illustrates the use of AM and FM oscillators to create an
&quot;analog&quot; electronic synthesizer sound.</p>

<pre>(defun warble (&amp;optional (dur 1) (pch 60))
  (stretch dur 
    (sum (mult
           (env 0.017 0.1 0.004 1 0.7 0.8 1)
           (amosc pch (fmosc (hz-to-step 8) 
                             (pwl 0 4 0.2 -4 0.56 9 0.7 0 1 -8 1))))
         (mult (stretch 0.96 (env 0.2 0.09 0.07 0.92 0.8 0.6 1))
               (amosc pch (fmosc (* pch 1.414) 
                                 (pwl 0.2 80 0.5 4 0.9 1120 1 200 1)))))))</pre>

<p>This sound is the sum of two components. To find the two components, look for <code>(mult
...)</code>. Each of these components is the product of an envelope and an AM oscillator.
The first one modulates the AM oscillator with a low frequency (about 8 Hz) sinusoid
produced by an FM oscillator. The modulator varies in frequency according to a piece-wise
linear envelope.</p>

<p>The second component is similar, but uses a much higher modulating frequency in the
audio range, producing a ring-modulation effect. Another piece-wise linear envelope sweeps
the modulator frequency by as much as 1120 Hz.</p>

<h2>Thicker Texture</h2>

<p>A thicker texture can be obtained by playing copies of warble together with slight
parameter changes. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>(defun thicker ()
  (sim (scale 0.5 (at 0.00 (warble 8 48)))
       (scale 0.3 (at 0.05 (warble 8.05 47.9)))))</pre>

<h2><br>
Another FM Sound</h2>

<p>The following produces another analog-sounding FM texture:</p>

<pre>(defun mod (dur) 
  (stretch dur
    (mult (pwl 0 1000 .2 200 .5 8000 1 100 1)
	  (fmosc c4 (pwl 0 1 .5 3.25 1 .74 1)))))

(defun blurp (dur)
  (fmosc c3 (mult (osc 07 dur) (mod dur))))</pre>

<p>This example relies on a combination of AM and FM: the output is from an FM oscillator,
but its modulator is formed by multiplying (AM) two oscillators. The first is low
frequency (about 12 Hz), giving a warbling sound, and the second, generated by <code>(mod
dur)</code>, is another FM oscillator. It appears that the modulation generated by the
piece-wise linear function is almost insignificant. You might try scaling the expression
(pwl 0 1 .5 3.25 1 .74 1) in <code>mod</code> by varying amounts to see what happens.</p>

<p>The original duration of <code>blurp</code> was 3.1 (seconds), but longer versions are
interesting and reveal more detail.</p>
