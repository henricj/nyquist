<h1>
Multiple Band Effects Tutorial</h1>
This page describes how to use the bandfx library in Nyquist.
<h2>
What does it do?</h2>
The idea is very simple: separate the incoming signal into different frequency
bands. Apply an effect to each frequency band.
<br>For example, apply a delay, with longer delays at higher frequencies.
Then sum the outputs of the effects. In the delay example,
<br>the result will be something like a filter sweep -- the low frequencies
come out first, followed by increasingly higher frequencies.
<h2>
How does it work?</h2>
Frequency bands are separated using Nyquist's <font face="">reson</font>
filter. Although reson is not perfect for this job, it has the nice
<br>feature that there is a complementary areson filter that returns everything
removed by reson. We split off the lowest
<br>frequency band with reson, then apply areson to get the remainder of
the signal. We pass this through another reson
<br>tuned to the second band and use another areson to get the remainder.
Using a series of filters, we pull off all the
<br>band except for the last one, which is just whatever is left over.
<p>The function separate-into-bands constructs an array of frequency bands.
The function reconstruct-from-bands sums an
<br>array of frequency bands back into a single channel. Different functions
apply effects to the frequency band representation.
<br>Consult the code (see lib/bandfx.lsp) for details. You can use the
code as a template for creating your own multiple band effects.
<h2>
How can I use it?</h2>

<pre>> (load "bandfx")</pre>

<pre>> (f2)</pre>

<pre>> (f3)</pre>

<pre>> (f4)</pre>

<pre>> (f5)</pre>
The commands shown above will play some examples that are included in lib/bandfx.lsp.
You can read the code for
<br>a description of the functions and to see examples of their use. The
functions are also described in the Nyquist manual
<br>(see "multiple band effects" in the index).<i></i>
<p>The manual also describes some ways this library might be extended.
Please contribute some examples if you find these effects useful.
