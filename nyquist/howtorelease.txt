How to release Nyquist (notes from RBD to RBD):

New primitives should be entered into misc\transfiles.lsp
and then makefile.lsp should be used to generate a new
Makefile as well as sndfn.cl and sndfn.wcl. Run intgen
under Windows (or Mac) using intgen @sndfn.wcl

Edit Readme.txt to contain correct version number at top.

Add changes to Readme.txt changelog.

Edit runtime/nyinit.lsp to contain correct version number.

Edit documentation to contain correct version number.

Is documentation current and installed?
