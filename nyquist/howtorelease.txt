How to release Nyquist (notes from RBD to RBD):

Note: releases are now on sourceforge. The file names are
      nyqosx30n.tgz
      nyqsrc30n.zip
      setupnyqiderun30n.exe

New primitives should be entered into misc\transfiles.lsp
and then makefile.lsp should be used to generate a new
Makefile as well as sndfn.cl and sndfn.wcl. Run intgen
under Windows (or Mac) using intgen @sndfn.wcl

(Alternatively, with the new CMake files, the XLISP_C_Interfaces
project will build the interface files. You should check that they
appear in the right place or if not they should be manually copied.)

ON EITHER WINDOWS OR MAC

Edit Readme.txt to contain correct version number at top.

Add changes to Readme.txt changelog.

Edit runtime/nyinit.lsp to contain correct version number.

Edit documentation to contain correct version number.

Is documentation current and installed?
[Update and Commit via SVN]

To rebuild documentation:
    cd docsrc
    toafs.bat (or toafs.sh) -- copies source to afs
    on afs, scribe nyquistman
        ps2pdf nyquistman.ps
    on afs, scribe nyquistman to text: 
        scribe nyquistman.mss -file
        copy nyquistman.doc to nyqman.txt
    copy nyquistman.pdf to doc
    copy nyqman.txt to doc
    cd docsrc/s2h
    ny
    (load "$system-dir$/system.lsp") -- use the appropriate one
    (load "s2h") -- will load citations.lsp
    (load "do-nyquist-manual") -- runs s2h 2x to get cross-references
    (exit)
    mv doc/NyquistWords.txt to jnyqide/NyquistWords.txt

Update the version number in the code and save it
Possibly set the SourceDir in [setup] and save it

  , using the version number for NNN

Visit https://frs.sourceforge.net/webupload and upload setupnyqiderunNNN.exe

source misc/cmu/cmuinstallmac.sh

FOR PLIGHT DRUM MACHINE -- SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY

(this is a separate download because it is large)
source install-plight.sh

******************************************************
* OLD INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTOMATIC RELEASE TO CMU WEB: *
******************************************************

ON WINDOWS

Run release.bat to create release directory for nyquist_setup
Run Setup Generator and select nyquist_setup
Make sure Files:Source Directory is set to proper nyqrel just created by release.bat
Click Make

Run releasenyqwin.bat to create release directory for nyqwin_setup
Run Setup Generator and select nyqwin_setup
Make sure Files:Source Directory is set to proper nyqrelwin just created by releasenyqwin.bat
Click Make

... releasenyqide.bat ...

from the nyquist directory:
make sure nyquist/ny exists for execution by misc/cmu/cmuinstall.sh
    (copy it to nyquist/ny if not)
cd misc/cmu
run cmuinstall.bat or source cmuinstall.sh

IGNORE THIS -- DELETE AFTER VERSION 3.02
same thing on PPC, but use
cd ~/nyquist/misc/cmu
bash cmuinstallmac.sh
--- and use something like 232ppc for the version number

FOR THE MAC TO BUILD RELEASE FOR UNIX

the cmuinstall.sh file builds a source zip file and installs it
